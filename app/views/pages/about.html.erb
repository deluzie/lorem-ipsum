    <p class="textblock container-narrow">Lorem ipsum is a proxy of a text, a placeholder, to not be understood by the reader. Its role is one of a stand-in, taking up space, to be replaced with meaning in a later moment of time. It is meant for designing without content, layouts with no meaning. The commonly used version of this text is derived from a version of a text by roman philosoper Cicero from 1BC, <em>De finibus bonorum et malorum</em>. Though altered to a pseudo-latin, by adding and changing words, it still remains to be somewhat translatable. Lorem ipsum is more than it seems to be: it is more than a proxy, it is a text with meaning.
